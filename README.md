#### Steps to proceed for each topic from above table

1. Create a folder with the topic name as given in the above table.
2. Put all the data from the [open-contributions](https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Open-contributions) repository of this topic, in the created folder `(all the images scripts or extra files which are being used in markdown or notebook)`
> ipynb and .md files for a topic will be in same folder of named on the topic.
3. Try understanding the content and run the program.
4. Change the data if required.
